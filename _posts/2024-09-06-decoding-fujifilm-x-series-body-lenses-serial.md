    1st digit = Year: 1 = 2011, 2 = 2012, etc.   
    2nd digit/letter = Quarter:   
    I quarter = 1, 5, A, S, E, J, N    
    II quarter = 2, 6, B, T, F, K, P    
    III quarter = 3, 7, C, U, G, L, Q    
    IV quarter = 4, 8, D, W, H, M, R    
        
    Examples of determining the year and quarter of production:    
    Serial number 1Txxxxxx – the first position of the number – the number “1” means 2011, the second position of the number – “T” – means the 2nd quarter, accordingly the product was produced from April to June 2011.    
    Serial number 03xxxxxx – the first position of the number – the number “0” means 2010, the second position of the number – “3” – means the 3rd quarter, accordingly the product was produced from July to September 2010.    
    The production date itself is taken as the last day of the production quarter. Ie, if the camera is produced in the third quarter, the warranty period will be counted from September 30.    
        
    The third symbol(camera body) represents the sales region- helpful for determining warranty /service (ie-graymarket)    
    A = USA and M =asia outside Japan

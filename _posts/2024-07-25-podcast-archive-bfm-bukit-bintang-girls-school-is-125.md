> Bukit Bintang Girls’ School would’ve turned 125 years old if it was still standing today. Old Girls Kiang Chew Peng and Moey Yoke Lai reminisce about their high school years, share the anniversary activities they have in store for the year, and tell us about the Elena Cooke Education Fund, a scholarship named after - and intended to continue the legacy of - the school’s 10th and longest serving headmistress.

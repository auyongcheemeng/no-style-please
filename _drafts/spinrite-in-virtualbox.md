abstract

there used to be a easily search-able post on the inter-webs that describes the step by step but lately the exact post has been lost to time as the way search engines rank stuff has changed

therefore i'm writing my own, mostly for my own quick reference when I need a refresher [I don't do disk data recovery every day, just every now end then when disks start acting up or concerning stats in a SMART monitoring lool like Crystal DiskInfo]


steps
a bootable copy of SpinRite, preferably in ISO form
prep-work
creating a raw disk in Virtualbox
creation of a DOS virtual machine container

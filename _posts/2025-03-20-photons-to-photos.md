An oldie but goody, a site with charts and  data of various digital sensors of  modern and not so modern digital cameras. 

My first encouter of this site a few years ago was it's [Photographic Dynamic Range Chart](https://www.photonstophotos.net/Charts/PDR.htm) and interative [Optical Bench](https://www.photonstophotos.net/GeneralTopics/Lenses/OpticalBench/OpticalBench.htm).

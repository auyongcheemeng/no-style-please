Old article floating around for years, which I first saw featured on [MAKE magazine (2012)][make], outlines how to solder two solid core wires to NASA standards.

The technical specification document in question is [NASA-STD-8739.4 - WORKMANSHIP STANDARD FOR CRIMPING, INTERCONNECTING CABLES, HARNESSES, AND WIRING][nasa-specs] (2016-06-30)

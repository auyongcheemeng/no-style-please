*This one I always forget every now and then: I open up Virtualbox to update it and its extension pack, I have to do this. This time I'm bookmarking this in a post.*

For those of us for whatever reason can't just do the normal double click - install and needs to run the install in an system elavated command prompt. 

It's self explaintory below or refer to the reference documentation.

    VBoxManage extpack install --replace "updated_Extension_Pack.vbox-extpack"

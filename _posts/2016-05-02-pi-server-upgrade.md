Server migrated onto the newer [Raspberry Pi 3][] hardware. More powerful than the older Pi 1 Model B+ that was previously running the server.

PS: Same hardware running on my media center box. It's pretty neat being fast enough to be able to decode HD video (most 720p 1080p videos), tho needing proper cooling.
